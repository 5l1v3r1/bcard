SnapOnAir Lora BusinessCard - The first ever-made lora/lorawan communication tool you can store in your wallet.
The first true interactive business tool you can use to share media (video, files, picture...) to your contacts.
Based on the powerful ESP32 MicroControler , a 160x80 high resolution TFT IPS display, it is fully compatible with Arduino IDE 
C or PYTHON programming.

With protocole like LORA, LORAWAN, WIFI, BlueTooth, ESPNow , the card can bse used as a communication tool. 
It helps building IOT MESH networks, gateways , nodes ...

I'm looking for a non profit sponsor to help building millions and distribute all over the planet.
